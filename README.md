### Hello, I'm Chetan Belagavi 👋

I am passionate about technology and problem-solving. Here's a glimpse of my work:

## 🛠️ Projects
- #### Smart City Transportation System
    The Transport Agency Project in C++ is a user-interactive system that facilitates city selection, source and destination inputs, and calculates the distance and fare for a ride. It includes a login system for user authentication and displays available riders for selection. The system calculates the shortest distance between cities using a lookup table or graph and determines the fare based on a fixed rate per kilometer. Riders can be sorted and displayed based on ratings or availability. After the ride, the program collects user feedback and exits gracefully.

## 🚀 Skills
- C++, Python, JavaScript
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Web Development (React.js, Node.js)
